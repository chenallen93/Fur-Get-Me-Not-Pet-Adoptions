# Fur-Get-Me-Not-Pet-Adoptions
## Synopsis:
    Our App is designed to be a very easy and simple to use process for finding pets. It is more focused on finding pets that have been in shelters for a long time. We used the Google maps API and the Petfinder API to accomplish this. Aesthetics of the app were made from Bootstrap, materialize, and animation.css.
